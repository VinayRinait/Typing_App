<h1>Typo App</h1>

<p>The Typing Challenge App is a React application that allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy. It provides a user-friendly interface for practicing typing skills and measuring performance.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Timer:</strong> The app includes a timer that starts as soon as the user starts typing. The timer displays the elapsed time in minutes and seconds.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Text Change:</strong> The app presents a series of plain text strings that the user needs to type accurately and quickly. After each successful completion, a new text string is randomly selected from an array of plain text.

    <strong>User Input:</strong> The app captures the user's input and compares it with the expected text. It keeps track of the total characters typed, total incorrect characters typed, and the correctness of each character.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Results:</strong> When the user completes typing the entire text accurately, the app calculates the user's words per minute (WPM), accuracy percentage, and displays the results.
